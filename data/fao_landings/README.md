# fao_landings
The data files in this folder are obtained from the official FAO fishery landings reports.  THese files were obtained from the capture production zip folder downloaded form the [FAO web site](http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-capture-production/en)

 - `fao_global_production_1950_2018.csv` -- official landings statistics
 - `fao_country_names_groups.csv` -- renamed from `CL_FI_COUNTRY_GROUPS.csv`
 - `fao_species_name_groups.csv` -- renamed from `CL_FI_SPECIES_GROUPS.csv`
 
These files are used, along with other `data` files, to construct the files in `mapping_tables`.
