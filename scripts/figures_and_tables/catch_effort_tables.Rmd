knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Catch characterization

from match_catch_effort_gilman import fao_fisheries...


```{r }

fao_f_18 <- fao_fisheries %>% filter(year == "2018")

master_gear <- read_csv(here::here("mapping_tables/master_gear_mapping.csv"))

mg_gilman_gfw <- master_gear %>% select(GilmanGear25Code, GFWCategory)

tt <- fao_f_18 %>% 
  group_by(gear) %>% 
  summarise(gear_catch = sum(catch_fishery_area_spc)) %>% 
  left_join(mg_gilman_gfw, by=c("gear" = "GilmanGear25Code")) %>%
  arrange(-gear_catch)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
